	<p><i>Qazi Qidwatuddin was the progenitor of the Sunni Muslim community called Qidwai/Kidwai. The community is divided into five branches, one of which is made up of the direct lineal descendants of Qazi Qidwatuddin, also called Qazi Qidwa. Most of the Qidwais are familiar with the origin of their surname, which comes from the Arabic word “qidwa” (elevated). This word qidwa, with the sound of the vowel “i” suffixed to it, was adopted as the name of their clan by Qazi Moizuddin’s descendants, from his title Qidwatuddin. According to the tradition, Qazi Qidwatuddin ne Moizuddin, born in AH 530/1133 C.E., was the elder son of Malik Ghazi or Malik Shah or Merak Shah of Rum (modern Turkey). Of the three dynasties that ruled in Rum, the Seljuks, the Eldiguzids, and the Danishmends, it is only in the Danishmend dynasty that one comes across a king by the name of Malik Ghazi or Malik Shah or Merak Shah in the period mentioned. Therefore, Riaz-ur-Rehman Kidwai is of the view that Qazi Qidwa was most probably a scion of the Danishmend dynasty, though he also writes that the names of the ancestors of Malik Ghazi or Malik Shah or Merak Shah do not match with the names of Qazi Qidwa’s ancestors, as given in the genealogical table.. Dunlop is of the view that Seljuk, together with some of his courtiers, may well have followed the Khazars, whose army was commanded by his father Tuquq, also known as Timuryalik, in embracing Judaism.<br>

As the tradition goes, Malik Ghazi was succeeded by his younger son Nusratuddin (also known as Nuzratuddin), while the elder son Moizuddin alias Qidwa was made the Qazi-uz-Qazzat (Chief Justice with extensive powers) of the kingdom, as was the custom of the dynasty. This practice of making the elder son Qazi-uz-Qazzat was aimed at consolidating the base of Islam among the masses, as the religion was still new to the region, and the pre-Islamic pagan influences still lingered. It was the duty of the head Qazi of the kingdom to see that the subjects adhered to the Islamic code of law and way of life. The dual authority of the two brothers could not last long, and conflicts arose in just a few years’ time. Disillusioned after his futile efforts to check King Nusratuddin’s heavy drinking and debauchery, Qazi Qidwa renounced the comforts of royalty and embraced the simple Sufi way of life. Traveling through Syria, Iraq, and Iran, Qazi Qidwa reached India in AH 588/1191 C.E., with an entourage of about 1,200 people, which included his wife Sabiha, his son Izzudin, and about a thousand cavalry led by ten military commanders – Afrid, Farrukh, Jamshed, Askar, Sayeda, Sayeedan, Urdesher, and Jamshed. After substituting in Ajmer, Rajasthan, for the sufi Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, who was then on a pilgrimage to Mecca, he proceeded to Delhi in AH 590/1193 C.E., where Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori had established his control after defeating Prithviraj Chauhan in the First Battle of Tarain in 1191. Qazi Qidwa is said to have been offered the post of Qazi-uz-Qazzat of the yet to be established Delhi Sultanate, which he declined. He then led in several military expeditions in Barabanki and conquered 52 villages. Entrusting the control of these villages to his son Qazi Izzudin, he left for Ayodhya (District Faizabad) in AH 590/1193 C.E., where he stayed till his death in AH 605/1208 C.E.
<br>
The other theory of the Jewish origin of Qidwais is that propounded by Maulana Abdul Hai in his Malfuzat Firangi Mahal. According to it, Qazi Qidwa’s wife was a Bani Israil. Their descendants are the ones now known a Qidwais/Kidwais.
